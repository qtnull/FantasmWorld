Hi, there.
I'm Creta Park, creator of L10nMV.js.

This game is using L10nMV.js, it's featuring able text localization and replacing audio and images without modifying game files!

Of course, you can also make your own localized language pack.
If not, there was no reason to open this file... right?

You can read more guide at L10nMV.js's GitHub page :
